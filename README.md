# Understanding Polarity of Social Justice Tweets using Deep Learning Techniques
## DATASCI W266: Final Project

Given recent social events, understanding the change in sentiment polarity surrounding a specific event is beneficial in understanding how the world is perceiving them. Social media is a powerful platform that millions of people use to voice their opinions. Twitter allows users to categorize their voice towards certain events or movements through their hashtag(#) syntax. The general goal of the project is to use various natural language processing and deep learning techniques to analyze tweets surrounding controversial social events to understand how the general public reacts to those events as well as providing various methods in understanding the exact reaction through word clouds and graphs.
